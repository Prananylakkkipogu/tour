        "Marina Beach</strong> is a natural urban beach in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, along the Bay of Bengal.[1] The
        beach runs from near Fort St. George in the north to Foreshore Estate in the south, a distance of 6.0 km (3.7
        mi),[2] making it the longest natural urban beach in the country.[3][4][5] The Marina is primarily sandy, unlike
        the short, rocky formations that make up the Juhu Beach in Mumbai. The average width of the beach is 300 m (980
        ft)[6] and the width at the widest stretch is 437 m (1,434 ft). Bathing and swimming at the Marina Beach are
        legally prohibited because of the dangers, as the undercurrent is very turbulent. It is one of the most crowded
        beaches in the country and attracts about 30,000 visitors a day during weekdays[7] and 50,000 visitors a day
        during the weekends and on holidays.[8][9][10] During summer months, about 15,000 to 20,000 people visit the
        beach daily.[11]</p>
    <p>Before the 16th century, there were frequent incident of inundation of land near the coast due to rise in sea
        level. When the sea withdrew, several ridges and lagoons were left behind. On the southern side of Fort St.
        George, one such sand ridge ran from the mouth of the Cooum to the present site of the Presidency College. On
        the rear side of the ridge was a huge depression on which the college grounds were later developed. The ridge is
        the site of the present-day beach.[12] When Fort St. George was built in 1640, the sea was too close to the
        fort. The building of the harbour near the fort resulted in sand accretion to the south of the fort and the
        harbour and the sea, which was washing the ramparts of the fort, moved afar at about 2.5 km away from the fort
        creating a wide beach between the land and the sea</p>

    <p class="A">
        n August 1778, the governor of Madras granted 43 acres for an estate to a civil servant, who, subsequently in
        1793, assigned the grounds to a committee of 24 which then regulated the public amusements in the city. In 1821,
        the committee sold the main house and central garden space to E. S. Moorat, an Armenian merchant who, in turn,
        sold it back to the government in 1830. The government first used the buildings and the grounds as the
        collector's "Cutcherry" and later for the "Central Museum."[5] The museum was originally established in a
        building on College Road in Nungambakkam in the year 1851 and was shifted to the present site in 1854.</p>
